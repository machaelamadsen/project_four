Project 4 Proposal

For this project we will be analyzing a wine database that contains different 
characteristics of wine along with their quality ratings. We will combine the white 
wine dataset and red wine dataset using SQL. We will utilize Supervised Learning 
methods, specifically Random Forests, to predict wine quality based on 
characteristics (features). We will calculate the performance of the model and 
generate visualizations that show which features have the biggest impact on wine 
quality. We will also create a Tableau dashboard that summarizes the data.
